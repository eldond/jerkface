0. Do tests with GNU hello world according to https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/create-hello-world-rpm/
1. Copy GNU hello world
2. Edit documentation to replace friendly hello with jerkface
3. Install utilities
   - yum install texi2html texinfo 
   - apt-get install texinfo
4.  in doc/ folder, run makeinfo on jerkface.texi to make jerkface.info
5. The name of the main source file (hello.c) seems to be used to define names of other things, so it has to match. I used `sed -i 's/hello.c/jerkface.c/g' */*.*` with variants on the *s to hit everything.
6. Install GNU automake to get access to aclocal if not already installed ( http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/ )
